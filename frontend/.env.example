# ===========================================
# FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ===========================================
# 
# USAGE:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Update the values for your environment
# 3. Restart the development server
#
# ALL URLS ARE CONFIGURED FROM A SINGLE VARIABLE:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL controls everything - API, Admin, Payment, WebSocket
# ===========================================

# ===========================================
# BACKEND URL (REQUIRED)
# ===========================================
# This is the ONLY URL you need to set. All other URLs are derived from this.
#
# For LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://octopus-app-7g74s.ondigitalocean.app

# For PRODUCTION (uncomment and modify):
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://api.makemycrafts.com

# ===========================================
# OPTIONAL OVERRIDES (usually not needed)
# ===========================================
# Only set these if you need to point to different services
# By default, all services use VITE_BACKEND_URL (monolithic architecture)

# WebSocket URL (only if different from backend)
# VITE_ADMIN_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://api.makemycrafts.com/ws
